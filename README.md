# CSAM 

In this project we present CSAM (Certifiable Sharpness-Aware minimization) a novel algorithm 
where we aim to find a certifiably flat minima using IBP (Interval Bound Propagation). 

### Project Installation

To can install the dependencies in a clean python environment using pip : 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Project Evaluation
To run our code and generate all the plots presented in our report we invite you to
run the following notebooks : 
- notebooks/benchmark.ipynb (For Adversarial attacks evaluation)
- notebooks/continual_learning.ipynb (For Post-Training evaluation)

Thank you for the time you will take to carefully evaluate our project.
